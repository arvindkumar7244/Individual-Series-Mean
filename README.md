# Individual-Series-Mean
Program to Calculate Mean of an Individual Series
# Algorithm
#### Remark
Here , one dimensional array X of size n is used to store n values X¹, X² ,..., Xn of variable X and mean is calculated by using the formula
 
mean =  Σx / n 

#### Start

   read : n

   for i=1 to n by 1 do:

      read Xi

   endfor

   set sum = 0

   for i=0 to n by 1 do:

       set sum = sum + Xi
   endfor

   set am = sum / n

   write : "Arithmetic Mean = ", am

#### exit

# Output

How many elements are there : 5

Enter elements : 12 14 16 18 20

Mean of the series is : 16.0
